The file src/assets/images/product2.png is intended to be an image file. Since I cannot generate image files directly, please ensure that you have a suitable PNG image named "product2.png" with good quality and rounded corners saved in the specified directory. If you need help with the image itself, you may want to create or source it using an image editing tool or stock photo service.
